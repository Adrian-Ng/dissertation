\subsubsection{Stress Testing}

In stress testing, we look at extreme market movements as seen in the past.
For instance, we might want to look at the so-called \textit{Black Monday}, October 19, 1987, when the S\&P 500 moved by 22.3 standard deviations.
To test this, we set our market variables to equal those of that day and see how our VaR measures hold up.

We can also look at an entire period of stressed market conditions, such as during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
Our VaR estimate during this period is called \textit{stressed} VaR.
