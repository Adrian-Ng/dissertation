\subsection{Simulation}
There are two simulation methods used in the estimation of VaR: the \textit{Historical} and \textit{Monte Carlo} method.
In both these methods we attempt to generate a sizeable distribution of future price changes by sampling from the distribution of our market variables.
With the Historical method, we use historical data to generate our data. 
If we don't have much historical data, then this approach is of not much use.
With the Monte Carlo method, we generate data via a random walk.
