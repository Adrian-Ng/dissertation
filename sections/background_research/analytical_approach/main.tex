\subsection{Analytical Approach}
\label{section:analytical}

Our treatment in this section follows Hull \cite{Hull:2012} Chapter 21, page 478 onwards and Willmott \cite{Wilmott:2007} Chapter 22, page 461 onwards.

Now that we have discussed how to obtain estimates of daily volatilities and covariances from historical data, we now come to our first VaR measure in which these estimates can be used.
We will look at how to produce a VaR estimate for a single stock and portfolio of stocks. 
In the former, we assume a normal distribution and in the latter we assume a multivariate normal distribution.
In both cases, we specify a time horizon $\delta{t}$ and confidence-level $c$.
