\subsubsection{getMean()}

One of our main statistical assumptions is that, for a given vector of price changes $u_i$, its mean $\bar{u} = 0$.
Despite this, it is still useful to include a method that will return the mean of our array of price changes as a sanity check.
Indeed, this is how \lstinline|getMean()| is used in the class \lstinline|PortfolioInfo.java|, where we print a break-down of our portfolio.
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=33,firstline=33,lastline=36]{"./assets/Stats.java"}
In our implementation of this method, we simply iterate through each element in \lstinline|double[] singleVector| and sum their values.
Then we return the average of this sum.
