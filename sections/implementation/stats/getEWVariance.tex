\subsubsection{getEWVariance()}
This method returns an equal-weighted estimation of daily variance.
It is our Java implementation of equation~\ref{eqn:covariancexy}, which describes the calculation of the equal-weighted covariance between two market variables.
We implement this equation (and not the one that describes variance) out of convenience.
We are able to use it for estimating \textit{both} variance and covariance.
This is because this method takes two \lstinline|double[]| variables as inputs.
In computing the variance, both inputs must represent the same market variable.
That is, the covariance of a market variable is simply the variance.
When computing covariance the two inputs should represent different market variables.

We simply iterate through each element in \lstinline|double[] xVector| and \lstinline|double[] yVector| simultaneously and sum their product of their values.
Then we return the average of this sum.
