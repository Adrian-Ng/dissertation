\section{Experimentation}

We test four types of portfolio: single-stock, two-stock, three-stock, and three-stock with options on the stocks.
The stock symbols we use are: GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT.
We will look at each of these portfolios with 1-day and 10-day time horizons and 95\% and 99\% confidence levels.
Each experiment will use 5 years of data and perform back testing and stress testing, where our stress test is a five year back test beginning on 1st January 2007.
It's important to note that options were excluded from out portfolio during the stress test, due to a complete lack of data.
The full battery of inputs for each experiment can be found in \lstinline|runTests.java|.
