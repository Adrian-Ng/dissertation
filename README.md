# dissertation
This is my dissertation which I completed in August 2017 for my MSc. in Data Science & Analytics.

I wrote it in LaTeX. But I never version controlled it. This is just one giant initial commit (haha!).

It's not great. I mean one third of it could be shoved into the appendix. Oh well. It got an A.

# What do I do?

Click on `Dissertation.pdf` file to read it.

Or feel free to take a look at all the files in `./tex`. It's a real mess.
